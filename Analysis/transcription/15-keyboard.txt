The man was happy to hear his baby over the phone
The old woman loved teddy bears
The mother refused to pay money for her child to play on the swings in the park
The boy saw a cat jump off the boat
A group of people drank coffee inside a house
The boy started crying when the man told him that Santa Claus was not real

The boy cried when he realized that he could not play on the swings because it was wet from the rain
The lady loved soccer
