The mom took a flight with her baby to see her friend
The boy got a gift from his siblings
Santa Claus waved at the man while he rode his bicycle
The baby enjoys sunny days outside his house
The mom paid some money to have a swing installed outside her house
The man admired the flowers while sitting on the bench
The friends got a teddy bear with some money
The friends broke a mug at the hotel
The girl hosted a football game at her house
The woman thinks broccoli is better than hot dogs
