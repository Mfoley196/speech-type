    - autogen/ and figures/ have files and figures produced by the R scripts
    - transcription/ has the transcription phrase sets for all participants
    - createPhraseSet.py is the Python script to create phrase sets
    - parse_more.csv and parse_trans.csv have the parsed data that the R scripts use
    - experiment_phrases.csv has all the phrases composed by participants, and the corrected versions generated by reviewers (in correctMsg and gMsg)
    - data_comp_test.csv is output by parseInput.py, and has the correctMsg and gMsg columns manually added in before being used by parseMore.py
    - data_trans_test.csv is output by parseTrans.py, and is input for parseMoreTrans.py
    - parseInput.py and parseTrans.py are python scripts that take the raw data and parse it to an intermediate stage
    - parseMore.py and parseMoreTrans.py are used to further parse data for use in R
    - oovCalc.py is used for the out-of-vocab calculations, and uses email64k.txt
    - Mobile Input Experiment Survey Responses.csv has data for the survey responses
    - NASA-TLX Responses - Comp.csv and NASA-TLX Responses - Trans.csv have TLX data
    - Notes.docx - Notes for composition task on whether a participant preferred typing or speech
    - Notes - transcription.docx - Notes for transcription task on whether a participant preferred typing or speech
    - Speech Input Stats.Rmd & .html are the main analysis, and where figures are generated
    - Speech_Input_Block.Rmd & .html analyzes the effects of block on the data
    - Speech_Input_Corrections.Rmd & .html analyzes effect of phrases with and without corrections on data
    - Speech_Input_AC.Rmd & .html analyzes effects of autocorrect on data
    - Speech_Input_Triad.Rmd & .html analyzes the effects of image triads on data
    - TLX_Stats.Rmd & .html analyzes the TLX data, and the demographic survey data
