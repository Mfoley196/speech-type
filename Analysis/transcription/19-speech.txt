The girl did not understand why the boy was crying after losing his dog
The boy cooked some food for his turtle
The boy did not get any presents from his friends
The girl went home to cook after playing soccer
The doctor had an apple tree outside his house
The flight attendant gave some toys to the child in the plane
The cat and the boy played around in the sailboat
The woman paid money to ride on the swing
The teddy bear asked for money from the kids
The boy saw Santa riding a bicycle
