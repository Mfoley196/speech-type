The dad plays music to the baby to keep him calm
The doctor is flying to the United States to see the boy
Doctor suggests to eat an apple everyday
The turtle likes what he is cooking
He sees a flower on the bench
The flight attendant asks if everything is alright
He hates playing outside when it's raining
They bought a stuffed animal as a present
The family gave the little boy a big surprise
They enjoy a cup of coffee at his friend's house
