People dress up as giant teddy bears to make cash
The woman wants to buy broccoli with her hot dog
The guy makes a turtle-shaped pancake
The guy accidentally squashes a flower when he sits on the bench
The guy makes sounds using his phone so the baby will laugh
The lady sews a heart on to the teddy bear
The guy kicks the soccer ball into a heart-shaped building
The swing set drifted away in the flood from the heavy rain, making the boy sad
The guy wants a bike from santa
A soccer ball flies through the window of the house and lands in the dinner being cooked
