The girl did not understand that her dog made the boy cry
The flight attendant moved the woman and her child to a more comfortable seat in the plane
The three men enjoyed coffee at home
The man sat on a bench with a flower in his hand
The man was going to cook a turtle in a pan!
The man took a picture of the baby with his cellphone
The boy found a cat on the ship
The baby was kept indoors when the sun was out
The boy got a cycle from Santa
The boy cried because he could not ride on the swing since it was raining
