While cooking Jane heard the sound of a ball bouncing on the hall
The boy placed his cat in the miniature boat to take a picture
Jane is craving a hot dog with broccoli
Joe was seated in the park staring at the flowers
Joe is capturing his grandson smile with his new phone
The doctor boarded an international flight to visit the boy
Jane bought an entire park with her savings
The sunlight enters daily through the window and makes the baby happy
Jane wished farewell to her nieces as they boarded the flight
All the siblings start their daily routines with a cup of coffee
