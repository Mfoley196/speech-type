The girl loved cooking indoors and playing football outdoors
The boy imagined the Santa riding on a bicycle
The woman spent a lot of money to buy her child a swing to play with
The air hostess welcomed the woman and her baby on the plane
The boy loved playing football
The baby was happy to go out of the house when it was sunny
The little girl took the cat with her when she boarded the ship
An apple a day keeps the doctor away from the house
The boy loved eating and playing with his toy turtle
The three friends had a great time having coffee inside the house
