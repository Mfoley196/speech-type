The boy cooks a turtle for dinner
Santa Claus gives the boy a bike for Christmas
A dog runs away from his owner and intrudes in his neighbour's yard
A woman likes her hotdogs with broccoli
A baby smiles at the sun through his bedroom window
The man is waiting for his date on a park bench with flowers
The boy loves soccer
The baby knows how to use a smartphone better than his grandpa
A flight attendant waves at her and her baby while she boards a flight
A doctor eats an apple before he leaves for work
