The boy is crying because his dad did not buy him anything for Christmas
She enjoys cooking and coaching soccer
He still had to deliver newspapers on Christmas
They are saving up money to buy a gift for Mom
They have some hot chocolate at home
The weather ruined his day at the playground
The baby enjoys the warmth of the sunshine into her room
The boy and the cat go swimming in the lake
She builds a swing in her backyard
The flight attendant asks if the mother has flown on a plane before
