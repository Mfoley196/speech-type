For Christmas, the man wanted a new bike
The young mom was tight on a budget so she brought her child to the park
The old man liked sitting on park benches and looking over the garden
When the girl is at home, she loved to cook and play soccer
The teacher taught her students that broccoli is healthy while hot dogs are not
Her friends surprised her by buying a new teddy bear
The boy was sad when his dad told him Santa wasn't real
For the boy's birthday he invited all his friends over and received many gifts
One day he was so angry he hit his pet turtle with a pan
The grandma loved her grandson so much she bought him a teddy bear
