The boy cried because his dad explained Santa is not real
The family bought a new teddy bear
The cat ran past the baby and knocked the sail boat toy down
The man fried a turtle in the pan
The girl had to choose between healthy broccoli and a hot dog for lunch
Mothers wonder why their children are upset about pet dogs
The family gave the boy a present
The mother needed money to buy a playground
The baby went outside the house for sunshine
Grandfathers let their grandchildren play with smartphones
