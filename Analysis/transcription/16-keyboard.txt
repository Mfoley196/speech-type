Apples are a staple at the doctor's house
Mom called Santa Claus to make the crying boy happy
The old with man loves the teddy bear she got as a gift
The baby wanted to get a swing while the mother wanted to get money from the bank
The friends gave the boy a present
The boy cried when the swing got wet because of the rain
The doctor took a flight to visit his son
Dad's phone's ringtone makes the baby happy
The man looked at the flowers while sitting on the bench in the park
The woman cooked a meal for the pet turtle
