The boy buys presents for his friends
The old man sat on the bench looking at flowers
The boy took his cat on a yacht
The friends come home for a cup of tea
The lady earns money by baby sitting the baby and taking it to swings
The boy went to see Santa on his bike
The boy likes soccer and hearts
The boy cooked food in the pan to feed his turtle
The girl is confused why the boy cried at the sight of the dog
People love teddy bears and money
