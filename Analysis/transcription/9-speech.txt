The little boy and his friends went shopping and got themselves lots of presents
Rain rain go away come again another day
The teddy bear loves his grandma
The man jumped out of the plane to save the little boy
The kids threw hot chocolate on the house that gave them no candy
The doctor didn't eat apples while he was at his home
The sun laughed at the baby while the baby was laughing in the house
The woman was wondering why the boy was crying and the dog was wondering the same thing
The boy took his cat onto the ship
The young boy cried when he found out his dad was Santa Claus
