The dog always jumped on the boy and his mother never understood why
The hotdog reeked of broccoli so the woman didn't eat it
The flight attendant graciously greeted the mother and her baby, both wearing matching hats
The three friends turn to drinking when they couldn't find a fall sublet
The flowers growing around the bench this year were beautiful, and the man admired them
Santa thought it would be a great idea to buy a bike for Lenny
The three friends made lots of money sewing together toy animals for children
The boy loved soccer
The typical soccer mom lives in a nice suburban house and cooks food
