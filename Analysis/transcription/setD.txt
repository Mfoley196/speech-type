The man was torn between his love and his love for soccer
The woman found money on the ground next to the swing set
The doctor on the airplane gave the little boy a lolly pop
Tell me went on a sail cruise and met a little kitty cat
Joe saw someone using a Santa Claus costume while biking
The baby stays in the house so that he's not sunburned
The person makes a soccer ball shaped cake in the house
The mother could not afford to take her baby to the park
A teddy bear cost too much money for the teenagers to buy
The woman thinks that hot dogs taste better than broccoli
