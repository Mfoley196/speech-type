The group of friends split the cost of the boy's gift
Her love of soccer motivated her to eat healthy
The friends were invited in for a coffee
The baby gleefully danced to the music playing on his father's phone
She asked Santa to provide a gift for those less fortunate then herself
As she looked over at her crying child, she wondered why she didn't adopt a dog instead
The man used the pan to scoop the turtle out of the river
The doctor always kept fresh fruit in her home
The sun shine through the window of the home, lighting the baby's room
The young mother and her friend boarded the airplane together
