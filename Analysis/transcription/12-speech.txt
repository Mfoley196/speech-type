The friends went to enjoy some coffee at one of their homes
Old ladies love teddy bears
Men like to cook turtles
The boy was sad because it was raining and he couldn't play outside
Boys love football
The doctor told the child to be careful on the airplane
The doctor grows apples outside of his practice
The girl likes hot dogs but not broccoli
The flight attendant said women & children first please
The boy wondered what his friends got him as a gift
