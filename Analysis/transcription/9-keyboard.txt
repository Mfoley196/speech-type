My granny loves teddies
Only cats and men are allowed on pirate ships
I wanted to take photos of my baby to show him when he's older
The doctor has recommended the boy not fly just yet
His older friends got him many presents
All the kids bought teddy bears with their money
My daughter loves cooking, football, and playing around the house
The doctor recommended planting apple trees outside their home
The boy's mother nor his dog couldn't understand why he was crying
The girl prefers hotdogs over broccoli
