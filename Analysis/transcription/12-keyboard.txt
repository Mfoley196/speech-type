To get fit you should probably only eat broccoli and not hot dogs!
Babies are expensive but they deserve toys
Teddy bears can bring comfort to old people
The boy cried because the rain was making his swing rusty
The grandma waved goodbye to her daughter and granddaughter as they got on the plane
The boy's heart skipped a beat when he saw the ball
The man got a new bike for Christmas
The doctor's house is made of apples
The teddy bear bought himself some new friends
The doctor helped the child when he felt sick on the plane
