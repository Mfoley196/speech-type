My mother would always prefer her broccoli over hot dogs
Emily and her baby had a really nice flight because of the flight attendant
John loved his football
I love having birthdays with my friends because I like getting gifts
Mitch really wanted to be on the swing set but his plans got canceled because of the rain
Being a vegetarian Tom cannot imagine people consuming tortoise meat
The baby likes getting out of the house to get some sun
Me and my mom used to love going to the fair even if it cost us a lot of money
The gardener planted flowers around the bench in the park
My cousins pitched in money for my birthday and got me a teddy bear
