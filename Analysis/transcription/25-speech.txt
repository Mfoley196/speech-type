The man would rather pick a flower then sit on the bench
They can't decide between pursuing love or soccer
The boy cries on the swing set as it starts to rain
The boy and the cat take a sailboat
Eating an apple makes the doctor feel at home
The teddy bear misses the love of his grandma
The girl prefers eating a home-cooked meal over playing soccer
The woman says goodbye to her daughter and granddaughter as they fly away
The woman likes hot dogs more than broccoli
Santa can easily tell who is naughty and nice
