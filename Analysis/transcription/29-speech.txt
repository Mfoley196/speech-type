The man set up on the bench to smell the flowers
The baby danced in front of his house because the sun was smiling
Cats ride sailboats and children
The baby jumped out of the present for his family
The baby showed Grandpa how to use a smartphone
The doctor brought an apple home from work
The boy cried because the swing broke just in time for the rain
Siblings buy presents for the teddy bear
The mother found money in the playground
The waitress serve hot dogs and broccoli
