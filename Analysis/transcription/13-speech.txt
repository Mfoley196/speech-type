The boy prepared a present for his family
A boy is crying because he saw a man dressed up as Santa Claus
The boy is playing with a toy ship with his cat
The mom is taking her baby to a swing but you have to pay to play
The lady has a broccoli and hotdogs for dinner
The baby is at home during daytime
A boy is crying because a dog is running towards him and a girl is wondering why
Friends are coming over to our house for coffee
This guy loves soccer
A man rode his bicycle to work; his work is to dress up as a Santa Claus
