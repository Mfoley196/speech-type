The man cooked lettuce for his turtle
They are having a tea party at their house
The boy rode his bike to the North Pole to visit Santa Claus
The stewardess asked the mother to get off the plane
The bay was crying because the playground was wet after the rain
The boys bought a teddy bear for her birthday
The boy could not take his cat to the docks
The old woman likes stuffed toys
The doctor planted an apple tree by his house
The man took his crying brother to visit Santa Claus at the mall
