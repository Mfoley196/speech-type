The baby's room was bright when the sun was up
The woman's stuffed bear had a heart on its shirt
It was raining, so the boy could not play on the swing
The man's turtle crawled into the frying pan
The man stopped to pick flowers by the bench
The girl put broccoli on her hot dog
The girl was confused why her brother was sad about the dog
The doctor planted an apple tree outside of his house
The boy cried because his brother was dressed as Santa Claus
The girl left her soccer ball at home
