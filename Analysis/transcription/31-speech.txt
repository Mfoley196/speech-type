The man found a turtle lying in his frying pan
The baby took the man's phone
The doctor always had apples in his house
A woman was cooking in her kitchen when suddenly a soccer ball went through her window
A man found a flower on the bench
The boy played with his toy boat and cat
The boy cried when he found out Santa Claus was a regular man in costume
The man rode his bike to go see Santa Claus
There were two women and a baby on the plane
The woman cooked vegetables and hot dogs
