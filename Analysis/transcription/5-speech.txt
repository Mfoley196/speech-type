The little boy was told that his friends were a gift
The teacher said that broccoli and sausages don't go well together
Doctors have apples at home
The girl wondered why the dog was running and the boy was crying
The three friends had coffee in the purple house
The boy noticed that there was a cat in the boat
The rain prevented the boy from using the swing
The man cycled all the way to meet Santa
The girl felt it was unfair to pay to use the swing
The boy stopped crying when he saw Santa and it was shown by his dad
