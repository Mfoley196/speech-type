My dad always used his cellphone to entertain me as a baby
Jerry likes having breakfast with his pet tortoise
I wish to see Santa ride a bike from the North Pole
Growing up me and my siblings were not allowed to have coffee at home
My mum saved up to buy a swing set for me when I was a baby
Medically babies should not be allowed on flights
Emily always plans her meals before she goes out playing
The dog bit the boy, leaving the owner confused
Growing up I was scared of Santa, but not anymore
The baby loves sun bathing on the terrace of his home
