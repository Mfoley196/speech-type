The three friends paid money to build a bear
The man loves soccer
The three friends gave a gift to a little boy
The man cooked food on a frying pan for his turtle
The baby crawled outside his house in the sun
The boy cried because he was not allowed to swing in the rain
A mom paid money for a swing set for her son
The man gave his phone to a baby
The three friends meet up for coffee at their house
The doctor ate an apple while at home
