The man is sitting on a bench and looking at the flower
The man thought the turtle looks like a frying pan
The baby who lives in the house is happy when it sees the sun
The man loves soccer
The girl is wondering what made the boy crying and she suspects it's her dog
The boy on the swing cried because it rained
The woman bought a swing for her kid
The old woman loves teddy bears
The lady prefers broccoli to hot dogs
Three friends got together at a house and had coffee
